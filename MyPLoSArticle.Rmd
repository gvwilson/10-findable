  Library science principles offer a framework and methodology for working through the maze of information generated in professional life.  Information ecosystems are composed of users, context, and content, and all 3 areas need to be addressed to make information findable.  Scientists should define their users and needs and then leverage the structural elements of the software they use to create, store, and access information before they can refine their content and how they present it via naming and subject metadata.  Ultimately, improving findability promotes the scientist's work through contribution, iteration, and dissemination of information and ideas.

# Introduction

Scientific professionals have long managed a significant amount of information in their work, but the continued "exponential growth of electronic data increasingly calls for new means of organizing and accessing information" [@Hedden2016].  The resulting glut of information, "has also led to the creation of new technologies to help people organize, find, and make better use of information" [@Rosenfeld2015].  Trying to find a particular bit of information at the moment of need can waste precious time and cause unnecessary frustration.  On top of this, the information scientists need often resides in many formats and is shared with varied audiences, sometimes in multiple versions.  Luckily, librarians make a career out of helping people find information and use information management technologies.  Our skills can be applied by any researcher who feels overwhelmed with information management in their professional life.

Library science principles offer a framework and methodology for working through the maze of information generated in professional life.  To frame the following ten rules, know that information ecosystems are composed of three parts: users, context, and content [@Rosenfeld2015].  Successfully solving the challenges of information retrieval at the point of need requires addressing the people who use your information, the context within which it is created, as well as the actual content it contains.  


#User Rules

## 1. Know Your Users
The first step in acheiving findability is to establish *who* will find your stuff, well before you make any changes to your content, site or the software you use.  Your users are the individuals who have a "viable and legitimate interest in the work you're doing" [@Covert2014].  In a professional context, your users are vital to your work in several ways.  Through contributions, they can help you iterate your own work or expand upon it in their work.  They are also transmitters of the information you share through their work and networks.  Your users are therefore a vital component of your own professional career and serving their information needs ultimately benefits you tremendously.

Depending on your content and the nature of your role, you might have only a small, expert audience.  If your work is publicly available, however, accept the idea that complete novices will find your work and that your user base is actually quite large.  Novice users should be able to understand and navigate your content just as well as a subject experts.  This much broader range of users means that you would expect a wide spectrum of content knowledge as well as facility navigating your discipline's routine practices.  Remember: your future self is also one of your users!

The information you wish to convey and they way it is currently organized probably makes perfect sense to you.  Any meaning made by your users, however, is completely subjective to their experience.  That knowledge is "*whatever a user interprets* from the arrangement or sequence of things they encounter" [@Covert2014].  This is another way of saying that the organization structure(s) you employ are a communication channel in their own right, in addition to the domain knowledge you share.  In addition to knowing who your users are and how important they are to the impact of your work, remember that any information you transmit to them is shaped by the mechanism(s) you use.

## 2. Define Your Findability Problem
Before you can design a solution, you must first establish both the extent of the problem as well as the end state you seek.  Those two elements, together, are the *why* that drives this process.  Given how easy it is to create information in a digital environment and the plethora of software tools and formats you employ personally and professionally, it is quite likely that your information is a bit of a mess.  "The first step to taming any mess is to shine a light on it so you can outline its edges and depths" [@Covert2014].  This means taking a look at both **what** information you have and **where** it is located.  Once you know hte full scope of the problem you have, only then can you move towards greater findability.

Creating a picture of the end state you will achieve through information organization can be personally motivating, yet in this context your users needs should be paramount.  You must figure out what your users will consider a good outcome, and "[e]very decision you make should support what you've defined as good" [@Covert2014].  Note that this  may not completely overlap with what you define as good for your work process.  However, the entire point of organizing information is to make it findable to ourselves and many others, so you will need to balance your workflow needs with the needs of your users, rather than assuming that their needs perfectly match your own.

Remember too, that the question of how to find something can actually have several different, possibly overlapping meanings!  Users may need to find your work on the web, find a specific item within a website, and/or find a particular piece of information within a specific file or webpage.  Depending on your content, you may have challenges in all three areas!  There are fine-tuning techniques appropriate for each and the remaining tips related to context and content will help you address the full scope of your findability problem.

#Context Rules

## 3. Utilize textual structure
Your information's context is one aspect of structural communication.  Findability issues at the document, post, or article level can be addressed by maximizing your softwares' structural options for text.  Taking advantage of these elements in each software type you use functionally improves the organization and navigational support as well as retrieval support for your users [@Hedden2016].  Basically, it helps users navigate content and find what they need, which is the essence of findability.

A key component of web searching is scanning text in search of your target information.  Textual structure helps with that process [@Krug2014].  Examples of this are using heading functions and bulleted or numbered lists where appropriate, so is highlighting terms that are important.  Depending on the software program you are using, headings and table of contents can be hyperlinked, which supports both scanning and navigation.  Textual content is created and aggregated in so many forms using so many different programs that specific strategies beyond headings, lists and highlighting terms is difficult.  Generally, you want to exploit the features of the textual program---your word processing software, data agregator, or other information-processing-tool---to the greatest degree possible.

## 4. Add Metadata
Just like people who end up with piles of photographs with nothing written on the back,  we all have digital mounds of files and content with no format or subject information in the Properties.  Unorganized and inconsistently organized professional work leads to frustration, while the benefits of having metadata are huge, for users and for you.  Metadata adds extra access points for information retrieval, which gives users more avenues to find what they need.  However, the metadata you are able to add depends on the software used to create, store, and access your information.

Many file storage, word processing programs and website software actually have built-in metadata capabilities, though they may be hard to find and harder to understand how to leverage.  The worst part may be getting into the habit of adding metadata to your content after creation.    You’ll need to have done some thinking about format and subject, but if your website software has any metadata functionality (like tagging; see tip 9), you will want to take advantage of the additional discoverability.  If you ever have a choice of software, one that makes use of metadata and structural labels enhances search tremendously.  It is also useful to examine how metadata can be transferred form an old syste to a new system, if you have the luxury of multiple software options.

## 5. Utilize Search **and** Browsing
Research into information-seeking behavior shows that people use a combination of searching AND browsing when they’re trying to find information they need [@Rosenfeld2015].  As they browse a website or document or file, they put together a mental map of the content they could possibly find and make a search based on that assumption.  "In the process, they modify their information requests as they learn more about what they need and what informaiton is available from the system" [@Rosenfeld2015].  They’ll further refine their search as they see results, perhaps navigating into a result or two to further their understanding.    You’ve probably seen or done something similar with a print book, trying to determine if it’s one you want.  These two functions work together because search allows users to find information they know they need whereas browsing allows users to find information they don't know that they need [@Bates20021].

Given this behavior, it’s important to provide access to your information through both methods and to "look for ways to support moving easily from search to browse and back again" [@Rosenfeld2015]. Tags and other metadata help with searching and browsing a list of tags, a table of contents, or even a file directory tells users a lot about the content contained in the information they are looking at.  Textual signifiers and software structures also help users navigate between searching and browsing by making the information framework visible to the users.  That communication, "enbales the answers to users' questions to 'rise' to the surface" and answer questions like, "Where am I?  What's here?  Where can I go from here?" [@Rosenfeld2015].  These are essential wayfinding questions on the way to findability and interact closely with the navigational choices you make for your information.

## 6. Mimic Real World Directions
Note that even in a digital environment, the language used mirrors physical directions.  Give your users a virtual map with sign posts and directions so they can figure out where they need to go.  Using the navigational metaphor completely is very helpful to ensuring that you help your users as much as possible, because "the words you use in the navigation systems and headings of [your content] help you find what you're looking *for*, but they also help you understand what you're looking *at*" [@Arango2018].  Navigation is yet another structural element that provides context to your users and communicates important information about your work and how they can find what they need.

As a content creator, you might think that since your audience is educated, that they’ll have either an innate understanding of the way you’ve structured your content, or unlimited patience to persist until they get what they need.  In reality, users scan, but don’t read, click on the first close thing they see and give up really, really soon.  Making things findable means that it is your job to make sure the user gets the information they need from the stuff you have.  Breadcrumb trails and menus on websites, and headings, file paths, & table of contents on documents/files give your users a sense of where the information resides as part of the larger information ecosystem they are currently 'in' as well as which new paths they can take [@Krug2014].  Much like highway navigation signs are consistent with regards to appearance, style and type of information, you want your directions to be clear and consistent throughout your information ecosystem.  

#Content Rules

## 7. Name for Finding
File and site naming affect findability both in terms of how they interact with your search application and how human-readable they are once they are retrieved as search results or through browsing.  Naming can be a challenge because of the need to balance a human-readable name that conveys the 'aboutness' of the item as well as a pattern or schema that is also machine-readable.  For file directories with many files, leveraging machine-readable components like sorting with a particular date format could automatically place files in an order that enhances findability.  The utility of one choice over another hearkens back to what you defined as *good* for your users.

There are many ways to develop a naming schema, largely related to the nature of the information you create.  At the most basic level, "you should use consistent names for the same reason that you use good file organization: so you can easily find and use data later.  Additionally, good naming helps you avoid duplicate information"[@Briney2015].  Condistency is key: choosing your preferred case, preferred date format (YYYMMDD or YYYY-MM-DD will both sort chronologically), and any project or source codes are all areas where standardization will benefit anyone searching for information.

If you have things to name that are not files, perhaps projects or webpages or even document headings, remember that while opaque or general names might sound good, they can be nearly impossible to find later if they do not reference the actual subject they contain.  Taking inspiration from file naming best practices, ensure that your names have enough information that they immediately and uniquely identify what they contain or reference.  When naming, you will want to imagine that someone will enter the name into a search box at some point in the future.  Will it lead them back to this particular item or content?  It should.   Also, think about nicknames or shortened versions of your names and make sure they are present in text or tags so that the content can be discovered by a search engine and a user.

## 8. Use Tags
Software metadata choices are part of the structural context of your information, but what you choose to put in metadata fields related to content subject and formats depends on your source material.  Additionally, digital information can handle multiple tags, which aides searching.  Be consistent in your depth of topical term assignment and selection of terms for subject and format.  Choosing which terms you will use may not matter much for your discipline beyond a need for consistency.  However, if your discipline has a established thesaurus, it can be great source for standardized subject terms.  Thesauri have a built in subject hierarchy, which can be helpful as you create a navigational structure.  Examples of thesauri include:
*Astronomy Thesaurus
*Getty Art & Architetcure Thesaurus
*Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) Thesaurus
*NASA Thesaurus
*UNESCO Thesaurus
*GBA Thesaurs of Geosciences
*Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
[@ASI2020]

These types of term lists are controlled vocabularies.  They have a defined list of ‘official’ terms that is created & maintained by an ‘expert’ of some sort.  There may or may not be relationships built between terms: equivalencies (CA = California), broader/narrower terms, and/or replacement (weed USE marijuana).  One benefit of using established subject terms is that they that will match article databases and library catalogs you and your users might already be familiar with.

Alternatively, you might create your own list of subject keywords, which are called folksonomies.  Folksonomies are like what you see with tags on Flickr---the content creator assigns terms as they see fit.  Additionally, users can tag with whatever terms they like and the list of possible terms is both uncontrolled (no one is watching for synonyms or misspellings) and crowd-sourced (created by non-experts).    The good news is that there is probably a place you can find tags in use that are a similar topic or content to yours that will inspire the tag structure and/or terms you’ll want to use.  If you create your own list of content terms, beware of plural/singular discrepancies in your terms and be sure to review that list on a regular basis for errors and misspellings.  

## 9. Understand the Difference Between Form & Substance
When you create metadata tags, you will often need to address the distinction between format and subject.  This adds another layer of conceptual analysis to your tagging process.  It is important to understand that there are terms to describe what your content IS (format), and also terms to describe what it is ABOUT (subject) [@Joudrey2015].  About-ness is the most common content analysis, but you will likely have issues of is-ness that affect your users and will want to add another layer of metadata to address what the information **is** in addition to what it is **about**.  

Going back to your users, what subjects are important to them?  And, do those topics carry over or change between differences in format?  This is basically a question of combined terms—are your format terms uniquely matched to topical terms (blog posts are always about news), or do you have multiple topics in each format (blog posts and tutorials on the same subject)?  When you think of file formats, sometimes the software takes care of that format analysis for you, if data is stored in CSV files or a presentation is in Keynote or PowerPoint.  However, dissemination sometimes removes a file from its orginal format (think printing slides to a PDF), in which case careful naming and metadata conventions would recommend putting the format into the name and/or file metadata.  Once you are aware of format and subject analysis, you will likely see more opportunities to distinguish information sources for your users.

## 10. Do Not Abbreviate
Spelling out acronyms and abbreviations breaks down the exclusivity of language used by a select group and it makes people feel welcome when they find your information.  As an expert in your field, you "can no longer imagine what it's like to *not* see the world that way" [@Wilson2020], and will have to work to ensure that the information you share with your users is accessible to them.  Especially with acronyms, remember that they are often repurposed by different professions or disciplines and what seems obvious to you is probably not obvious to a number of other people.  Given that your discpline likely has many common abbreviations, you can write out all abbreviations and acronyms in their full form, write them out the first time they appear, or create or point to a term dictionary.  


Changing work habits is hard, and you must decide whether to start new work with a clean slate of new information rules or if you must go back and alter---perhaps rename---any work product [@Briney2015].  Remember that while "perfection isn't possible, progress is" [@Covert2014].  Creating and structuring 'good' information for your users is your goal, but these rules and the "ways you enforce your way of doing things changes how users think about the place[s] you made and perhaps ultimately, how they think about you" [@Covert2014].  Circling back to the network of users you are situated among, making your stuff findable is a truly impactful way to disseminate your work to them that will positively change your network and your career.
