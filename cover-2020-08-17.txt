To whom it may concern,

Thank you for your feedback on our paper "Ten Quick Tips for Making Things
Findable".  We have brought on a third author with specialist knowledge in order
to add more specific examples as requested by your reviewer, and hope that this
revision addresses the issues that they raised. The file "10-findable.pdf" is
the updated version, while "third-submission-changes.pdf" highlights
alterations.

Please note: I was unable to find a way to add an author at this stage via
EditorialManager, and would be grateful if you could do so on our behalf:

    Dr. Ibraheem Ali
    Louise M. Darling Biomedical Library
    University of California, Los Angeles
    ibraheemali@library.ucla.edu

Thank you for your consideration,
Sarah Lin, Ibraheem Ali, and Greg Wilson
